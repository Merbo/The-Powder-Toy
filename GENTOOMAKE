Making this in gentoo is a little different, as this was made for Gentoo itself.
In order to build all this and send it to your 'Executables/' directory, you'll need to do the following:
make final
'make final' does many things:
- Makes all possible packages your system can compile
--> That way you can push all executables available.
- Runs 'make clean'
--> By running 'make clean' it will remove the object files that can cause clutter.
- Copies executables from various places in 'build/' to 'Executables'
--> By doing this, end users will have it easy. 
- Completely erases all non-directory files in 'build/'
--> This way, your next 'make final' will be nice and clean.
