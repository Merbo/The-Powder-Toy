Making this in gentoo is a little different, as this was made for Gentoo itself.
In order to build all this and send it to your Executables/ directory, you'll need to do the following:
make <packages>
Example: make powder && make powder-64-sse3
THEN, you have to do make final.
Example: make final
"make final" does two things:
- Runs 'make clean'
--> By running 'make clean' it will remove the object files that can cause clutter.
- Copies executables from various places in 'build/' to 'Executables'
--> By doing this, end users will have it easy.
